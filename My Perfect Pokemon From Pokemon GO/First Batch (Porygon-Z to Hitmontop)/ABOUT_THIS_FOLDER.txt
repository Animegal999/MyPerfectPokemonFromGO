At Green River College, I took a couple of Data Science classes that utilized
the Jupyter notebooks that use python. In that class, I was to use Google Colab,
for a final project. The final project could use any dataset that we've either
collected on our own, or by using an online source like Kaggle. What I did was 
use data from a gaming app called Pokémon GO. 

This is one of many files that are about some of the Perfect Pokémon that I've
found in Pokémon GO. 

Pokémon GO is a mobile app game, released by Niantic in 2016. Since 2019, I’ve 
been interested in collecting as many of these Perfect Pokémon, since Pokémon GO 
doesn’t really have much of an end goal. I have compiled a massive Excel spreadsheet 
and database of my Perfect Pokémon that I’ve found, over the months and years. These 
Pokémon all have a “perfect” status, in the game. To find out if your Pokémon is a 
perfect, the “appraise” option will have your team leader evaluate the IVs or potential
strength of your Pokémon. If all bars are full, and the icon with the three stars turns red, 
then you have found a Perfect Pokémon. These are colloquially referred to as "hundos" by 
the community of Pokémon GO players.

ABOUT THE PAST DATA:
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

This data from the past details 100 "perfect" Pokémon that I have found, in order
to conduct interesting data points and patterns about them. What I wanted to look 
at were:

- Outliers in the data
- How tall or short each Pokémon was, in comparison to each other
- How heavy or light each Pokémon was, in comparison to each other
- Comparing their weights to the Pokémon's average heights and weights (From Bulbapedia and Video Game Data)

ABOUT THE FILES:
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

My_Perfects_PAST.csv is data on the first 100 Perfect Pokémon that I've found (Porygon-Z to Hitmontop). 
Information on each parameter and attribute:

- Pokémon Species: The Species of the Pokémon found (i.e., Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle)
- Nickname: Nicknames that are given to the Pokémon
- Type: The Pokémon's typing (e.g., Pikachu is an Electric-Type Pokémon)
- From Egg?: The Pokémon was hatched from an egg
- From Raid?: The Pokémon was defeated and captured from a Raid
- Random/Research Task?: The Pokémon was caught either in the wild, or from completing a research task
- From Rocket Grunt?: The Pokémon was caught after defeating a member of Team GO Rocket
- From Event?: The Pokémon was caught during an event
- Is Shiny?: The Pokémon has a different color than usual (e.g., Pikachu is slightly darker and has dark pink cheeks, as a Shiny)
- Height (m): The Pokémon's height in meters
- Weight (kg): The Pokémon's weight in kilograms
- Generation: The generation that the Pokémon is from (e.g., Pikachu is from Generation 1)
- Date Found: The date that the Pokémon was found on
- Location: The location that the Pokémon was caught or hatched at

What_Is_Pokemon_GO.docx is an explanation on what Pokémon GO is, including references and citations about Pokémon, Niantic, Nintendo, and
any other articles that are related to Pokémon. Citations are also included here. 

My_Perfects_First100.R is the R Programming language file that deciphers the data that is from the csv 
file. This is to demonstrate my skills with the R programming language, as well as including the .ipynb
file that does the same thing, but with Python and inside a Jupyter Notebook.

MyPerfectsPAST_DATA.ipynb is a Jupyter Source File that utilizes Python. I made this file
back in 2023 for one of my classes at Green River College. The file and analysis was initially barebones, 
but I've added a bit to this file as of recently, with the inclusion of scipy for projecting linear 
regression values, as well as viewing the correlation between a Pokémon's height and weight. 

First_100_PerfectPokemon.accdb is a Microsoft Access Database file that holds a database of the tables 
and data that are similar to the Excel workbook, as well as the csv file. However, this allows for SQL 
functions to help aggregate the data, unlike with Excel. There is no Shiny column in the database, because no Shiny Pokémon were found at that time. 

First_100_PerfectPokemon.sql is an SQL file that helps query and aggregate the data from the database that I made.
